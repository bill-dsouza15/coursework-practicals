A1 - Perform the following operations using Python on suitable data sets:
	1. Read a data from different formats(like csv,xls)
	2. Describe attributes of data, checking data types of each column, format of each column
	3. Counting unique values of data
	4. Converting variable data type (e.g. from long to short, vise versa)
	5. Indexing and selecting data, sort data
	6. Identifying missing values and fill in the missing values.

A2 - Perform the following operations using Python on the data sets :
	1. Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset (eg. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance  and percentiles).
	2. Data cleaning, Data integration, Data transformation
	3. Data Visualization - Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the feature distributions.

A3 - Perform the following:
	1. Build a Data model in Python for the dataset chosen in Assignment 1 or 2 and apply  Linear Regression/Logistic Regression.
	2. Infer the result using  accuracy score

A4 - Perform the following:
	1. Build a Data model in Python using any classification model (Decision Tree or  Na√Øve Bayes) and infer the result using accuracy score.
	2. Compare different classification models (not limited to NB and DT only) with respect to feature selection and accuracy. Infer the result: Which model is best suited for the dataset chosen?

A5 - Perform the following:
	1. Visualize the data and its outcome in Python by plotting the various graphs.
	2. Use Scatter plot, Bar plot, Box plot and Histogram.
